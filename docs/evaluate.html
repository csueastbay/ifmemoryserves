    <h2>Research Questions</h2>
    
    <dt>RQ1: </dt>
    <dd>How could playing a digital game be leveraged to scaffold student understanding of, and interest in, the abstract ideas in computer science education?
    </dd>
    <dt>RQ2: </dt>
    <dd>How can the effectiveness of digital games for computer science education be validated?
    </dd>
    </dl>
    
    <dl class="callout">
    <h2>Hypothesis:</h2>
    <dt>Hypothesis 1 (Knowledge):</dt>
    <dd>Students playing If Memory Serves in tandem with traditional learning activities (e.g., readings, lecture, etc.) will perform better on a test of conceptual knowledge on pointers (i.e., purpose, usage and syntax, tracing and prediction, debugging, etc.) than those students who only participate in the traditional learning activities.
    </dd>
    <dt>Hypothesis 2 (Engagement):</dt>
    <dd>Students playing If Memory Serves in tandem with traditional learning activities (e.g., readings, lecture, etc.) will report a higher level of engagement with their learning activity on pointers than those students who only participate in the traditional learning activities.
    </dd>
    <dt>Hypothesis 3 (Attitude):</dt>
    <dd>Students playing If Memory Serves in tandem with traditional learning activities (e.g., readings, lecture, etc.) will report greater confidence and positivity about their mastery of pointers than those students who only participate in the traditional learning activities.
    </dd>
    <dt>Hypothesis 4 (Behavior):</dt>
    <dd>Students playing If Memory Serves in tandem with traditional learning activities (e.g., readings, lecture, etc.) will be observed to spend more time-on-task and apply different learning strategies than those students who only participate in the traditional learning activities.
    </dd>
    <dt>Hypothesis 5 (Skills):</dt>
    <dd>Students playing If Memory Serves in tandem with traditional learning activities (e.g., readings, lecture, etc.) will demonstrate more apt and coherent use of pointers in a programming assignment (measured by functional coherence, source code sophistication, and source code maintainability) than those students who only participate in the traditional learning activities.
    </dd>
    
    </dl>
    <p>In our Working Group Report, we also suggest study designs and instruments that can be used to test each of the hypotheses. Although any research on this game is not limited to these questions, hypotheses, or research methods, we encourage others to evaluate this game so that it can continue to evolve and be a meaningful teaching tool.
