        <h2>Game Development for Computer Science Education</h2>
        <p>Games could become a valuable tool for enriching computer science education, since they can facilitate a number of conditions that can promote learning and instigate affective change. As part of the <i>22nd ACM Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education </i>(ITiCSE 2017), the Working Group on Game Development for Computer Science Education convened to extend their prior work, a review of the literature and a review of over 120 educational games that support computing instruction. </p><p>The Working Group continued to examine the potential effectiveness of games in the computer science education classroom. To achieve this in a limited time frame, the working group chose to design and develop a game based on specific learning objectives with the intention of providing the source code for the game to the computing education community for further review, adaptation, and exploration. To aid this endeavor, the Working Group also chose to explore the research methods needed to establish validity, highlighting a need for more rigorous approaches to evaluating the effectiveness of the use of games in the computer science education context.
        </p><p>This site provides a brief description of the design and development of <i>If Memory Serves</i>, a game to support teaching pointers to undergraduate students. We invite you to explore the game and to use the materials provided for conducting
          your own study on the gameâ€™s effectiveness.

        <small>The game was created with the following learning objectives in mind:
