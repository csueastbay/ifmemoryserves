        <h1>[DRAFT] Working Group 2: Game Development for Computer Science Education</h1>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Games could be a valuable tool for enriching computer science education, since they can facilitate a number of conditions that can promote learning and can instigate affective change. As part of 22nd ACM Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology
          in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE 2017), the Working Group on Game Development for Computer Science Education convened to extend their prior work, a review of the literature and a review of existing games that support computing instruction,
          in order to examine the potential effectiveness of games in the computer science education classroom. To this end, the group developed a new educational game, Alloc, to support CS3 students in developing their understanding of pointers. Furthermore,
          guidelines to validate its effectiveness are proposed. This report provides a summary of the need for more rigorous approaches to evaluating the effectiveness of games in the computer science education context, a case study description of the
          design and development process for Alloc, and a roadmap for its further development and validation.
